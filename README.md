## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript Vanilla

### Continued development

I still need to learn a lot about animation, especially timing-function.  
I should also train with z-index (I couldn't make a halo around winner's logo that is underneath other elements) and make many more tests with gradients.

### Resources I got to use and things I learnt

- [SessionStorage](https://code-garage.fr/blog/comment-utiliser-le-localstorage-pour-stocker-des-donnees-en-local-sur-le-navigateur/) - A useful reminded about Storage, the storage format, and how to convert data type when using what is stored in JavaScript
- [Differences in testing if variables are empty in JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4597900/checking-something-isempty-in-javascript) - Useful summary
- [object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit)
- Gradient cannot be applied to borders
- [display none !important](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20663712/css-display-none-not-working)
- [Maintain the final state of an animation : animation-fill-mode: forwards;](https://prograide.com/pregunta/30191/maintien-de-letat-final-a-la-fin-dune-animation-css3)
- [setTimeout](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/wait-1-second-then#:~:text=To%20delay%20a%20function%20execution,call%20fn%20after%201%20second.)
