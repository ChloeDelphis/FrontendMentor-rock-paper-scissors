## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript Vanilla

### Continued development

I still need to learn a lot about animation, especially timing-function.  
I should also train with z-index (I couldn't make a halo around winner's logo that is underneath other elements) and make many more tests with gradients.

### Resources I got to use and things I learnt

- [Differences in testing if variables are empty in JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4597900/checking-something-isempty-in-javascript) - Useful summary
- [object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit)
- Gradient cannot be applied to borders
- [display none !important](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20663712/css-display-none-not-working)
- [Maintain the final state of an animation : animation-fill-mode: forwards;](https://prograide.com/pregunta/30191/maintien-de-letat-final-a-la-fin-dune-animation-css3)
